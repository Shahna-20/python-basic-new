# Create Tuple With one item

# To create a tuple with only one item,
# you have to add a comma after the item,
# Otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple

# One item tuple, remember the comma.

thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#NOT a Tuple

thistuple1 = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple1))
