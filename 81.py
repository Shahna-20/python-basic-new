# Customize Sort Function

#You can also customize your own function by
# using the keyword argument key = function.
# The function will return
# a number that will be used to sort the list (the lowest number first)


#Sort the list based on how close the number is to 50.

def myfunc(n):
    return abs(n - 50)

thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]

thislist.sort(key = myfunc )
print(thislist)


#myfunc(100) returns abs(100 - 50) = 50
#myfunc(50) returns abs(50 - 50) = 0
#myfunc(65) returns abs(65 - 50) = 15
#myfunc(82) returns abs(82 - 50) = 32
#myfunc(23) returns abs(23 - 50) = 27


#The list is sorted based on these returned values:
#50 (from 100)
#0 (from 50)
#15 (from 65)
#32 (from 82)
#27 (from 23)
#The sorted order of the list will be: [50, 65, 23, 82, 100],
# which corresponds to sorting by the absolute difference from 50.
