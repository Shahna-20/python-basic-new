#Slicing Strings

#You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

#Specify the start index and the end index,
#separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.


#Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included)

b = "hallo, world"
print(b[2:5]) # stop index is not added

# the first character has index 0
